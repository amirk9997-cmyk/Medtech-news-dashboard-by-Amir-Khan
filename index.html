                    <h3>R&D alert: Research and development spending stalls in the 2025 Medtech Big 100 ranking</h3>
                    <p>The 2025 Medtech Big 100 ranking shows record-high revenue of $486.7 billion for the world's largest medical device companies, up 3%, but R&D spending grew less than 1% to $29.2 billion, slowing after recent double-digit growth. Factors include higher material costs from import taxes and potential FDA slowdowns. Companies like Johnson & Johnson MedTech and Intuitive Surgical increased R&D, while Medtronic plans to boost spending in 2026 for cardiac and surgical innovations.</p>
